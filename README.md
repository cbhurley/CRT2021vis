## Data visualization with R

Data visualisation is core to meaningful data presentation, and plays a central tool in descriptive statistics. Effective visualization enables observers to analyse and reason about data. It makes complex data accessible, understandable, and usable. In these lectures, we give an introduction to data visualisation in the R programming language using ggplot.

Participants require computers with the software R and the related interface (IDE) RStudio. These should be installed before the lecture.
